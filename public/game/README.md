# Reality Consumption Engine — App Edition v1.7.0

A complete browser port of the Godot/Android prototype. The game runs as a static web application with a deterministic Canvas civilization renderer and a responsive DOM management layer.

## Run locally

No `npm install` is required for the prebuilt release.

### Node.js

```bash
node server.mjs
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

To use another port:

```bash
PORT=4173 node server.mjs
```

### Any static web server

You can also serve the extracted folder with any static web server. The precompiled JavaScript is already in `dist/`.

Do not rely on double-clicking `index.html`; ES modules are intended to be served over HTTP(S).

## Build from TypeScript source

The release includes all TypeScript sources in `src/`. If `tsc` is installed:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run the regression suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Browser architecture

- `src/game/` — deterministic simulation, progression, prestige, saves, intervention paths
- `src/render/` — deterministic Canvas civilization renderer
- `src/ui/` — responsive DOM HUD, panels, controls, intervention choices
- `src/data/` — generated content ported from the Godot catalogs
- `dist/` — precompiled browser JavaScript
- `tests/` — Node regression tests

## v1.7.0 pressure with a cost, a harvest signal, and a world that paints only what it shows

v1.7.0 closes three gaps between the v1.5.0 design and the shipped engine, and takes the
renderer off drawing the parts of the world nobody can see.

**Entropy now costs something below 100.** It used to cost nothing at all: `cascadeDecay`
fires only at the threshold, so the four alarm bands the interface names were free, and
obeying them measured as 69 seconds of run and 2 Cultivation Credits worse than ignoring
them. Development growth now keeps 1.000 / 0.969 / 0.875 / 0.719 / 0.500 of its rate at
Entropy 0 / 25 / 50 / 75 / 100. Runs are not shorter, only shallower, and the survival curve
is untouched.

**The stay-or-harvest moment is computed and shown.** The tactical rail carries the harvest
grade, Cultivation Depth, the next depth band and the yield, and states in words whether the
next credit still fits in the run — measured against how long the run can actually last,
which counts the vents Stability can still pay for, not the bare cascade floor. A chaotic
harvest now keeps 60% of its credits rounded rather than floored, so a cascade costs a
3-credit run a third of them instead of two thirds.

**Accelerate pays a one-off price.** The years it injects no longer inflate the Entropy rate
for the rest of the run. Accelerating builds gain 9-11% yield; runs that never accelerate are
unchanged. Waiting still wins at every containment level, so the action's direct costs remain
an open balance question.

**The world paints its visible slice.** Both canvas layers used to draw the full world width —
four viewports at stage 4, of which one is on screen — on every scrolled pixel and, for the
dynamic layer, thirty times a second. Draw work is down 55-62% on the cached layer and 51-68%
on the animated one, with the number of visible primitives identical at every scroll position.
The world's mood also glides now instead of stepping in four jumps, new structures are seen to
arrive rather than appearing between blinks, and on phones the tactical actions sit in a 2x2
grid with the cascade clock and harvest call moved onto the world itself.

**Saves from v1.6.0 are carried over.** `SAVE_VERSION` stays 4; the fields added to a
running Civilization in v1.7.0 are optional and default cleanly, so an in-progress run
behaves exactly as it did when it was written.

## v1.6.0 victory and milestones (Historical)

v1.6.0 gives the game an explicit win condition. Meta progress unlocks the **Great
Convergence**: a terminal cultivation that starts in APOTHEOSIS, runs at 1.6x Entropy, pays
no Cultivation Credits and no resources, and is won by a controlled harvest at Cultivation
Depth 14 or deeper. Failing it costs nothing but the run.

A 28-entry **Milestone Register** is now visible in the machine view. It holds the eleven
milestones that previously awarded Machine Insight invisibly, plus seventeen new ones, each
with its progress and its award.

Every convergence is permanent and stacks: x1.25 harvest yield and +2 Containment per
victory, with the next convergence demanding three more milestones, two more multiverses,
one more level on every Axiom and four more Cultivation Depth.

**Saves from v1.5.0 and earlier are not carried over.** `SAVE_VERSION` is now 4 and older
saves are discarded on load.

Median of nine seeds in the terminal run under the safety choice policy with Vent and Stabilize:

| Build | Median depth reached | Range | Median run |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Four modules at level 1 | 6.2 | 4.6 - 9.3 | 141 s |
| Deep machine build | 18.6 | 14.8 - 24.6 | 525 s |
| Maximum with Stable Constants | 53.9 | 41.6 - 68.2 | 1627 s |

A shallow build cannot clear Depth 14, a deep build clears it with little margin, and a maximal
build clears the scaled targets of several further convergences. The target is a single constant,
`CONVERGENCE_BASE_DEPTH` in `public/game/src/game/convergence.ts`.

## v1.5.0 balance curve

v1.5.0 replaces binary survival with a continuous containment curve, replaces the capped harvest
grade with a continuous Cultivation Depth, and adds an Entropy Vent plus three mid-run machine
interventions. Median of nine seeds under the safety choice policy at 1x speed:

| Build | Containment | Median run |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| No upgrades | 0 | 181 s |
| Four modules at level 1 | 4 | 360 s |
| Deep machine build | 14 | 654 s |
| Maximum with Stable Constants | 28 | 988 s |

- `entropyRate` is `0.48 * (1 + years / 6500) / (1 + 0.4 * containment)`, and containment sums
  upgrade **levels** across Reality Lattice, Awareness Scrubber, Sanity Protocol, Cosmic Muffling
  and the Universe upgrade Stable Constants. Every level is measurable; nothing is binary.
- Cascade decay is 7% of maximum Stability per second, so it lasts about 14 seconds for any build.
- Cultivation Depth is `development / 80 + 1.5` per completed path arc. Yield multiplier and credits
  scale off it, so staying deeper is the central roguelite decision. The four harvest grades become
  display bands over depth, joined by a fifth, **Singular**, from depth 16. A chaotic harvest keeps
  60% of its credits and 40% of its resources.
- Accelerate still costs 2 Control; only its Entropy surcharge dropped from 7 to 5. Entropy Vent
  costs 1 Control and 10 Stability, removes up to 18 Entropy and pays the removed amount into the
  harvest as Paradox.
- The three machine reserve interventions cost `base * 3^usesThisRun * (1 + depth / 4)`, capped at
  three uses each, which keeps them a net loss on resources.
- APOTHEOSIS is a fourth era from 14,000 years, reachable only by developed builds, with twelve new
  interventions and its own cadence.
- Universe residue scales with credits earned: 32 at 18 credits and a bank of 8,000, against 5
  before. Universe upgrade growth is capped at 1.75, bringing the full catalog to 567 residue.

## Renderer behavior

The production boot uses the built-in deterministic Canvas renderer. Structural scenery is cached and rebuilt only when meaningful state bands change; atmosphere, settlement lights, traffic, and decision impulses update independently. There is no second renderer and no game framework: the Civilization world is drawn entirely with Canvas 2D.

## Save data

Version 1.5.0 writes the v3 save format. The `localStorage` key is unchanged, but the version gate discards every v2 payload on load, so existing progress is lost and there is no migration. v1 browser saves and Godot saves remain unsupported. The game has no offline progression.
